# GEP-LR
The GEP-LR algorithm encodes a regression function in the LR model using GEP algorithm instead of using the maximum likelihood estimation based on a priori assumption of linearity. This GEP-LR modeling codes were constructed based on the GEP algorithm of Ferreira (2006) and the geppy codes package (Gao, 2020) in conjunction with Python.
